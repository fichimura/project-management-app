  <h2>Installation/How to use it</h2>
  <p>Since this is a react app build with help of Vite, you need the requisites of Vite. In the date of this project the official site says: 'Vite requires Node.js version 18+. 20+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.'. Therefore you must have node in your machine.</p>
  <p>Once you have the requirements, run the following commands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Git clone this repository</li>
    <li>
      <code>npm i</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>npm run dev</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Finally this will enable you to access the app in the default port configured by Vite.</p>
